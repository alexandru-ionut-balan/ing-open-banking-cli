# ING Open Banking CLI

The ING Open Banking Command Line Interface (CLI) is implemented with scripts. These scripts can be used to
test your connection to the ING sandbox for Open Banking APIs*. It is your starting point to create wonderful 
apps using ING APIs!

## Test your connection to ING:

* Call OAuth API to get a token
* Call Open Banking API* with the token

## Choose your test environment:

* [Bash](/scripts/bash/README.md) Readme
* [Node.js](/scripts/javascript/README.md) Readme

## Software Development Kit (SDK)

We are also working on an SDK for frictionless calls to Open Banking APIs.
The SDK provide drivers that can be used directly in your applications to connect to ING.
